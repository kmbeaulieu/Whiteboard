--------------------------
Executable - Whiteboard.jar
--------------------------
Notes:
The src files are originally an eclipse project but some teammates imported to netbeans to take advantage of it's gui builder.

After rearranging methods for client/server, the shape table model now says the canvas associated with it is null. The messages of sending the commands for a client work though. If the listener for the table would work everything should fall into place. 
--------------------------

Neat extras:
-mouse wheel scroll on a selected item
-shortcuts for actions like saving or making a client/server
